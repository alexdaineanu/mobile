### Requirements:
Each student should define the features for an app that will support, at least, the following:
* an input form
* a list of items
* display a chart
* authentication
* offline support - persist data on the local storage
* online support - synchronize date to/from a remote location
* intent - eg. show map coordinates on google maps, or send an email using gmail
* animations

### My idea
My idea is to create an application which allows you to manage food recipes, allowing you to add your own recipes, with photos.
Sharing is caring, so the application has the option to send a recipe to your aunt (or friend) via Email and upload to the global food library where everybody can see your recipe. 
One of the first world problem is what do I cook today? So our application gives you ideas about what to cook today (recipe of the day).
